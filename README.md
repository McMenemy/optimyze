## Features
- user accounts with secure authentication
- graphical visualization of estimated time saved from an optimization
- search functionality of optimizations by category or title
- post, edit, and save optimization options for signed-in users

## Technology
Optimyze is a single-page asynchronous app using Ruby on Rails and React with a SQL database.

## Future Features
- can change the graph to see time saved over different time intervals
- up-vote and down-vote optimizations
- easily copy an optimization to your optimizations
- a meta data component that show's users how much time they would save from all their optimizations
- an user can 'track' an optimization and input data of how much time they saved and then the user can compare actual time saved to the estimated time saved
- take into consideration other factors of an optimization such as health and financial effects
